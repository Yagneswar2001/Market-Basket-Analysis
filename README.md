# Market-Basket-Analysis
Market basket analysis is a strategic data mining technique used by retailers to enhance sales by gaining a deeper understanding of customer purchasing patterns. This method entails the examination of substantial datasets, such as historical purchase records, in order to unveil inherent product groupings and identify items that tend to be bought together. 

By recognizing these patterns of co-occurrence, retailers can make informed decisions to optimize inventory management, devise effective marketing strategies, employ cross-selling tactics, and even refine store layout for improved customer engagement.

For example, if customers are buying milk, how probably are they to also buy bread (and which kind of bread) on the same trip to the supermarket? This information may lead to an increase in sales by helping retailers to do selective marketing based on predictions, cross-selling, and planning their ledge space for optimal product placement.
